-add logic for when the player dies (save high score, if valid, etc.)
-add a high-score system: implement wall of heroes, i.e. save the top 10 high scores and show them when the player dies.
-determine the reason for background randomly flashing during the game and fix. (fixed via rendering settings in 2d rendering project variables)
-add a regeneration system for the player. (they should regenerate x health per second; this should be modifiable)



to do: (in order of importance)


-configure collisions for environment and implement walls to block off zone boundaries (i believe this can be done with the tilemap painting system somehow.
-expand the tilemap for the first level.
-fix sounds on projectiles (not working due to the node pool setup. the original projectiles have sound, later ones randomly do or do not.)
-implement area2d collision zones so the player can pickup loot; coins, potions, etc.
-add player potions (increase attack speed, increase movement speed, increase damage) each buff lasts 10 seconds.
-add a loot drop system
-add dialogue for the main screen to setup the game (use dialogic addon for godot to create this)
-find cool fonts for all of the in game ui and assets
-add coin drops for future upgrade system
-eventually add npcs to introduce famous npcs from aldenexia
-modify and streamline the design of the monster spawning system so i can add in new monster types and add them to the spawners with the least amount of effort.
