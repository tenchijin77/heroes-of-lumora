-add a high-score system: implement wall of heroes, i.e. save the top 10 high scores and show them when the player dies.
-determine the reason for background randomly flashing during the game and fix. (fixed via rendering settings in 2d rendering project variables)
-add a regeneration system for the player. (they should regenerate x health per second; this should be modifiable)
-configure collisions for environment and implement walls to block off zone boundaries (i believe this can be done with the tilemap painting system somehow.
-fix sounds on projectiles (not working due to the node pool setup. the original projectiles have sound, later ones randomly do or do not.)
